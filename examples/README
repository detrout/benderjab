This directory contains a few examples of bots using the BenderJab bot 
framework.

aimlbot - calls PyAIML to come up with witty responses
          the bot class is a bit more complex to make it easy to
          call the read_eval_loop from an interpreter to fairly 
          easily try to debug your AIML files.

roller - uses pyparsing to figure out a fairly complete gamer
         die rolling language (e.g. 2d10 )

sysmon - gives a hint of how the framework could be used for system
         administration tasks. It tells what your current load average is
         and will change the away status when the load average goes over 5.

time_delay - sends you a message after N seconds have passed.
